# Hotel Reservation System

The Hotel Reservation System is a simple console-based Java application that allows users to:

- View available rooms.
- Make reservations.
- View existing bookings.
- Process payments during room reservations.

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a hotel booking system with a focus on simplicity and core functionalities like room management, reservations, and payment processing
## Features

- View Available Rooms
- Make a Reservation
- View Bookings
- Payment Processing


## Running the Program

- Compile and run the program using any Java compiler or IDE.
  
Run the Main class  : 
- View Available Rooms: Lists the rooms with their prices.
- Make a Reservation: Prompts you for the room number and payment amount.
- View Bookings: Displays all rooms that have been booked.
- Exit: Ends the program.
## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for extending this project:

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX.
- Implement a database (like MySQL or SQLite) for persistent storage of rooms and bookings.
- Add user authentication to support multiple user roles (e.g., admin, customer).
- Implement more detailed payment processing (e.g., credit card validation).
## Technologies Used

- Java: Core programming language used.
- OOP Concepts: The project is built using Object-Oriented Programming principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
